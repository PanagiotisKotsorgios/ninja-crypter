## How It Works With the Repository

- **Individual Daily Logs (`daily_dev/YYYY-MM-DD.txt`)**
  - Each developer creates **one file per day**.
  - Tracks tasks, files, summaries, and commit references.
  - Supports auditing, progress tracking, and accountability.

---

## Best Practices

- Update your daily `.txt` file at the **end of each workday**.  
- Include **all relevant tasks and files** even if small.  
- Keep **summaries concise but detailed enough** to understand what was done.  
- Reference **commit hashes or pull requests** for accountability.  
- Ensure **daily files are committed** to the repository to maintain historical logs.  
- Use clear and consistent formatting for readability.

---

## Optional Enhancements

- If multiple developers are working on the same day, append the **developer name to the filename**:  
  `daily_dev/2025-09-27_Panagiotis.txt`  
- Consider adding **optional tags** for type of work: `[ENCRYPTION]`, `[GUI]`, `[KMS]`, `[TEST]`.

---

## Summary

This daily development log system ensures:

- Consistent tracking of **tasks, files, and progress**
- **Accountability** through commit references
- Easy **auditing and review** for project leads
- Clear visibility of **days remaining until project completion**
