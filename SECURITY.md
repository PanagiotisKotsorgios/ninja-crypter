# Ninja Crypter Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security policies and best practices for the NinjaApp repository. This is a **private, commercial project**, and all authorized developers must adhere to these rules to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of the application.

---

## 1. General Security Principles
- **Confidentiality**: All source code, binaries, configuration files, and data are strictly confidential.  
- **Least Privilege**: Only access systems and data necessary for development.  
- **Secure Communication**: Use HTTPS, TLS, or company-approved secure channels for network operations.  
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Follow company standards for user access and API keys.

---

## 2. Handling Sensitive Data
- **User Data**: All personal or company user data must be encrypted before storage or transmission.  
- **Encryption Keys**: Never hardcode keys in the source code. Use secure storage (Java Keystore, environment variables, or company-approved secure vaults).  
- **Logging**: Do not log sensitive information (passwords, API keys, personal user data).

---

## 3. Encryption Guidelines
- **Use Strong Algorithms**: AES-256 for symmetric encryption, RSA-4096 for asymmetric, SHA-256 or higher for hashing.  
- **Initialization Vectors (IVs)**: Use random IVs where applicable.  
- **Key Rotation**: Follow company policies for rotating keys periodically.  
- **Crypto Utilities**: Use the `crypto/` module only for approved cryptographic operations. Do not bypass or modify crypto standards.

---

## 4. Network Security
- All communication with company servers must use **TLS/HTTPS**.  
- Validate all responses and handle exceptions properly to avoid crashes or leaks.  
- Avoid sending unnecessary user data. Only send what is required for functionality.  
- Any network requests must be reviewed to prevent leaks of confidential information.

---

## 5. Dependency & Library Security
- Only use **trusted libraries** in `libs/` or via company-approved Maven/Gradle repositories.  
- Keep dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.  
- Document any third-party libraries in `docs/Dependencies.md`.

---

## 6. Security Testing
- Write **unit tests** and **integration tests** for encryption and network modules.  
- Verify that sensitive data is encrypted/decrypted correctly.  
- Conduct **code reviews** for security-critical modules, especially `crypto/` and `network/`.

---

## 7. Reporting Security Issues
- If you find a vulnerability or breach:  
  1. Notify your team lead or manager immediately.  
  2. Document the issue privately with affected files and steps to reproduce.  
  3. Do not disclose the issue outside authorized company channels.

- All reports should be treated **confidentially**.
