# The Software Goal 

### Software Description

`Ninja Crypter` will be an enterprise file encryption tool that encrypts content and binary files so that even if file data is exfiltrated,
it cannot be decrypted without authorized keys. Must support **GUI**, **CLI**, **programmatic APIs**, **enterprise key management**, **secure sharing**, **auditability**, and best-practice **cryptography**.

> Its usage will be strictly from the AGROTECH I.K.E. Company and it shall not be shared to third party organisatiions, until it has become a sellable software solution
