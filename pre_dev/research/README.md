# Ninja Crypter â€” Research Notes

**Project Status:** Pre-Development  
**Purpose:** Collect and organize all research, references, and findings relevant to the Ninja Crypter encryption project.  

---

## 1. Cryptography Research

### 1.1 Symmetric Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM**  
  - Authenticated encryption (AEAD)  
  - Recommended for strong enterprise-grade encryption  
  - Uses 96-bit random IV per file  

- **XChaCha20-Poly1305**  
  - Alternative AEAD for platforms without AES-NI  
  - Streamable for large files  

- **Key Takeaways:**  
  - Always use AEAD; do not implement unauthenticated modes  
  - Random per-file keys improve security  

### 1.2 Asymmetric Encryption / Key Wrapping
- **RSA-OAEP (SHA-256)**  
  - Recommended key sizes: 4096+ bits  
  - Suitable for wrapping symmetric data keys  

- **ECIES (Curve25519 / X25519 + AEAD)**  
  - Ephemeral key exchange for secure file sharing  

- **Key Takeaways:**  
  - Hybrid encryption (symmetric + asymmetric) is needed for sharing  
  - Use AEAD for all wrapped keys  

### 1.3 Key Derivation & Hashing
- **HKDF (SHA-256 / SHA-512)** for subkey derivation  
- **Argon2id** for password-based encryption  
- **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** as a legacy option  
- **HMAC-SHA256** for message authentication  

### 1.4 Signing & Integrity
- **Ed25519** for file signing  
- **RSA-PSS** for release signing  
- **Metadata authentication** (version, timestamps, algorithm, recipients)

## 2. File Formats & Containers

- Containerized file format:  
  `Header + Metadata + Encrypted Data + Auth Tag + Optional Signature`  
- Versioned to support algorithm upgrades  
- Supports multiple recipients, each with wrapped data key  
- Streaming support for very large files  

---

## 3. Key Management & Storage

- **Master Key (MK)** stored in HSM or KMS (HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault)  
- **Data Key (DK)** generated per file, wrapped by MK or recipient public key  
- Key rotation strategies: rewrap DKs or re-encrypt files  
- RBAC-based key access policies  
- Audit logging for key events  
- Zeroization of keys in memory after use  

---

## 4. GUI & CLI Research

- **GUI**  
  - JavaFX recommended for cross-platform support  
  - Drag & drop functionality for files/folders  
  - Wizard flows for encryption and decryption  
  - Key Manager, Audit Log viewer, Policy & Settings panel  

- **CLI**  
  - Commands for encrypt, decrypt, share, rotate keys, and audit logs  
  - Scripting-friendly: exit codes, JSON output for automation  

- **API / SDK**  
  - Java SDK for programmatic encryption, decryption, and key management  
  - Internal REST endpoints for policy and telemetry

## 5. Libraries & Tools Evaluation

| Library / Tool | Purpose | Notes |
|----------------|--------|------|
| BouncyCastle | Cryptography primitives | Strong, widely used in Java |
| Google Tink | AEAD wrapper | Optional for simplifying AEAD |
| JavaFX | GUI | Cross-platform UI |
| Jackson / Gson | JSON | For metadata and config |
| SLF4J + Logback | Logging | Enterprise-grade logging |
| Apache HttpClient | Networking | For optional telemetry and policy sync |
| JUnit 5 | Testing | Unit and integration testing |
| Mockito | Testing | Mocking components |

---

## 6. Security Considerations

- Always use AEAD encryption modes  
- Fail-closed on errors to prevent data leaks  
- Ensure zeroization of keys and sensitive memory  
- Tamper detection for both files and metadata  
- FIPS-compliant options if required  

---

## 7. Platform & Development Notes

- Java 17+ for cross-platform compatibility  
- Target OS: Windows, macOS, Linux  
- Build tools: Maven or Gradle  
- Version control: GitHub / GitLab  
- CI/CD pipelines for testing, building, and code signing
