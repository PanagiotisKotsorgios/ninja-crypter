# Ninja Crypter — Installer Design Specification

**Project Status:** Pre-Development  
**Purpose:** Define the requirements and features of the Ninja Crypter installer for commercial distribution. This includes **secure fetching of executables, desktop integration, licensing, and professional installer behavior**.

---

## 1. Overview

The Ninja Crypter installer is designed to:

- Deploy the application **on company machines securely**
- Ensure proper **installation of encrypted storage and initial configuration**
- Provide **license agreement and company-specific branding**
- Create **desktop/start menu shortcuts**
- Optionally, fetch updates or installer files from a **secure company server**
- Support **silent and advanced installation modes** for enterprise deployment

---

## 2. Installer Features

### 2.1 Pre-Installation Checks

- Check for:
  - Sufficient disk space
  - OS compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
  - Java runtime environment (JRE) presence and correct version
  - User permissions (admin rights for system-wide installation if needed)
- Warn user or prevent installation if requirements are not met

### 2.2 License Agreement

- Display company **End User License Agreement (EULA)** before installation
- User must accept **before continuing**
- EULA should cover:
  - Commercial usage
  - Confidentiality of repository and software content
  - Prohibition of redistribution or reverse engineering

### 2.3 Installation Options

- **Typical Installation**:
  - Default installation path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\NinjaCrypter` or `/opt/ninjacrypter`)
  - Creates desktop icon
  - Creates Start Menu / Applications folder shortcut
- **Custom Installation**:
  - Custom installation path
  - Choose which components to install (CLI, GUI, SDK, sample files)
- **Silent Installation** (enterprise deployment):
  - Install with predefined parameters, no user interaction
  - Scriptable for multiple machines

### 2.4 Executable / Application Delivery

- Fetch application package from **secure company server** via HTTPS
- Verify **digital signature or checksum** before installing
- Store installer and temporary files securely during installation
- Allow for offline installation using **signed local installer package**

### 2.5 Encrypted Storage Initialization

- Installer creates **initial encrypted volume** for keys and data (if first-time install)
- Optionally launch **first-run setup wizard** after installation:
  - Configure master key
  - Initialize default DK storage, metadata, audit logs
  - Optionally configure user authentication and RBAC

### 2.6 Shortcut and Desktop Integration

- Create **desktop icon** with company branding  
- Add **Start Menu / Applications shortcut**  
- Optional: pin to taskbar or dock (OS-specific)  
- Shortcut should include command-line flags for advanced users (e.g., open directly to CLI mode)

### 2.7 Post-Installation

- Verify successful installation
- Offer to **launch application** immediately
- Provide **links to documentation** and support
- Log installation summary in **local encrypted audit log**

---

## 3. Security & Integrity Measures

- **Installer Signing**:
  - All installer binaries digitally signed to prevent tampering
- **Package Verification**:
  - Verify downloaded executable against known checksum (SHA-256) or signature
- **Secure Fetching**:
  - Only download installer from trusted company server over HTTPS
- **Minimal Privileges**:
  - Installer requests only necessary privileges
  - Avoid unnecessary elevation for non-critical components
- **Rollback & Error Handling**:
  - Automatic rollback if installation fails
  - Maintain log of installation steps for troubleshooting

---

## 4. Advanced Installer Features

- **Enterprise Deployment**:
  - MSI or `.deb/.rpm` packages for automated deployment
  - Configurable silent install parameters:
    ```
    ninja_installer.exe /S /D="C:\Program Files\NinjaCrypter" /INITSECUREVOLUME
    ```
- **First-Run Setup Wizard**:
  - Configure initial master key
  - Mount or create encrypted storage volume
  - Configure default DK storage paths
  - Optionally configure backup location
- **Telemetry/Policy Opt-In**:
  - Installer may include optional configuration for company-specific telemetry or policy compliance
