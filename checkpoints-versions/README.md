# Ninja Crypter â€” Checkpoints & Versions

This folder contains **major development checkpoints and versioned snapshots** of the Ninja Crypter project.  

It is used to:

- Track progress over time  
- Record **feature-complete milestones**  
- Store **screenshots, test reports, and release notes** for each version  
- Provide a **historical reference** for QA, dev, and management

3. Check `screenshots/` for GUI/feature previews at that checkpoint.  
4. Check `test-reports.md` for **unit/integration/fuzzing results**.
