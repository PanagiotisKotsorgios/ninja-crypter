**Date:** 2025-09-15

## Overview
- Completed preliminary research for encryption algorithms.
- Decided on AES-GCM, XChaCha20-Poly1305, RSA-OAEP, ECIES.
- Defined **core architecture**: GUI, CLI, KeyManager, Encrypted Storage.

## Tasks Completed
- Created initial design documents and diagrams.
- Defined folder structure and repository organization.
- Researched secure local storage options for keys and audit logs.

## Known Issues / Next Steps
- GUI skeleton needs implementation.
- CLI prototype needed.
- Encrypted volume design needs finalization.
